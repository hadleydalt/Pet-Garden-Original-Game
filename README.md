# Pet garden

* NOTE: I wrote this code during the culmination of an introductory programming class, which was my first experience with OOP and Java. Since then my coding skills have improved; this is not how I would structure the code today.

PET GARDEN
///////////////////////////////////

HOW TO PLAY
///////////////////////////////////

- You start the game with four randomly generated pets in your garden.
- Hover over each pet with the mouse to access its info card, which displays its Name, Personality, Birth Month, and Favorite Food.
- This information is also randomly generated, except for the name which you can change!

- TO CHANGE A PET'S NAME:
   + Hover over the pet
   + Type in the pet's new name
   + Click on the pet (in the garden) to confirm the name. You'll see a confirmation pop up in the info card.

- After you've named your pets, you can use the Search My Pets option to search for one. Just click on the "Search My Pets"
  button and type in a name to search. If it matches the name of one of your pets, that pet's info card will pop up.

- To earn money, you can enter the amount of hours you've spent studying using the "Enter Hours" button. After you press
  Enter, your hours will be converted to currency.

- To buy items from the store, click on the label below each item that says "Buy...". You can only buy items if you have
  enough money.

- EXTRA FEATURES:
  + You can view the store items sorted by price with the "Sort By Price" button.
  + If you don't want your pets to bounce you can click on the "Static Version" button in the top left and they'll freeze.
  + Buying a sunset will actually change the color of the sky in your garden.
  + Buying a hat will put a hat on any pet in your garden.


DESIGN CHOICES
///////////////////////////////////

All design choices are explained as annotations within the code.

There are probably a lot of areas where my code could be simplified and I am hoping to improve with code minimization in
the future.


KNOWN BUGS
///////////////////////////////////

Sometimes two hats might be added to the same pet. If you name two pets the same name, the search will only return one of them
which is the first one generated. There are probably more undiscovered bugs.


HOURS
